# PNlib
Free Modelica library for modelling xHPN.

## Library description
The advanced Petri Net library, called PNlib, enables the modeling of extended hybrid Petri Nets (xHPN). It comprises
 * discrete (PD) and continuous places (PC),
 * discrete (TD), stochastic (TS), and continuous transitions (TC), and
 * test (TA), inhibitor (IA), and read arcs (RA).

The main package PNlib is divided into the following sub-packages:
 * _Interfaces_: contains the connectors of the Petri net component models.
 * _Blocks_: contains blocks with specific procedures that are used in the Petri net component models.
 * _Functions_: contains functions with specific algorithmic procedures which are used in the Petri net component models.
 * _Constants_: contains constants which are used in the Petri net component models.
 * _Examples_: contains several examples and unit tests.

#### Release notes
* [Version v1.2](../../archive/v1.2.zip) (2015-10-19)
  * Added support for 64-bit systems
  * Revised some internal algorithm to archive less complex equation system structure
  * Minor bug fixes
* [Version v1.1](../../archive/v1.1.zip) (2015-01-13)
  * This is basically an adaptation of PNlib version 1.0 to Modelica 3.3 to remove tool dependencies (e.g. impure instead of __Dymola_pure annotation).
  * New function PNlib.Functions.Random.initRandom is introduced to make stochastic simulations reproducible.
* [Version v1.0](../../archive/v1.0.zip) (2012-05-15)
  * Initial release.

## Compatibility
* Works in OpenModelica 1.9.4 ([trend](https://test.openmodelica.org/libraries/history/PNlib-trend.svg), [coverage](https://test.openmodelica.org/libraries/PNlib/BuildModelRecursive.html))
* Works in Dymola 2016
