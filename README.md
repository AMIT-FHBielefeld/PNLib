# PNlib
Free library for Modeling xHPN

## Library description

The advanced Petri Net library, called PNlib, enables the modeling of extended hybrid Petri Nets (xHPN). It comprises
 * a discrete (PD) and a continuous place (PC),
 * a discrete (TD), a stochastic (TS), and a continuous transitions (TC), and
 * a test (TA), an inhibitor (IA), and a read arcs (RA).

The main package PNlib is divided into the following sub-packages:

 * Interfaces: contains the connectors of the Petri net component models.
 * Blocks: contains blocks with specific procedures that are used in the Petri net component models.
 * Functions: contains functions with specific algorithmic procedures which are used in the Petri net component models.
 * Constants: contains constants which are used in the Petri net component models.
 * Models: contains several examples and offers the possibility to structure further Petri net models.
